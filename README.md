# Project a Fake vs Real News ML classification. 
This repository is my submission for the technical test for the AI incubator team Data Scientist Role. 
The project was done entirely on R and I have included the main R markdown file as the main analysis script as well as the knitted pdf file. 
The datasets - that of - true.cv and false.csv are not included in this repository because of Github upload limits. 
In order to ensure easy reproducibility the datasets can be added to the same folder as the files in this repository. 
Please let me know if you experience any issues accessing or running the code.

Kind regards, 
Khyati Narang
